# Message-Detection
Employing the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to classify between spam and legitimate (ham) messages.

### Aim

This project aims to create a spam detection system, employing the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to classify between spam and legitimate (ham) messages. Additionally, I'll be using performance metrics to assess the strength of the classification model.

### Dataset

The dataset contains two columns: 
1. class - ham or spam,
2. message - descprition or content of the message.        
Sourced - Kaggle

**The spam classifier uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification. It utilizes the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn to convert text data into numerical features for model training and prediction.**
